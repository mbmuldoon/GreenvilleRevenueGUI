Chapter 3 Greenville Revenue Assignment Starter Project

In Chapter 2, you created a program for the Greenville Idol competition that prompts a user for the number of contestants entered in last year’s 
competition and in this year’s competition. The program displays the revenue expected for this year’s competition if each contestant pays a $25 entrance fee. The 
application also displays a statement that indicates whether this year’s competition has more contestants than last year’s. 

Now, create an interactive GUI program named GreenvilleRevenueGUI that performs all the same tasks.
